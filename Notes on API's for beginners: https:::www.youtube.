Notes on API's for beginners: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZvSYJDk-us


Interfaces abstract away the implementation. "We don't need to know how it works, we just need to know what we're allowed to change, or see"

GUI (Graphical User Interface): Is made for the user of the application
API (Application Programming Interface): Is made for the application programmer to use and extend in their applications

One way to think about it: API is a contract of sorts. It defines how its expected to be used and what you can expect to recieve by using it. 

They save you from having to create everything by yourself!


There exists local API's and remote API's. 
REST (REpresentational State Transfer) is a standard for remote API's. When API's are written in the style of REST and follow/embrace the REST rules, the API is said to be "RESTful".
